# Audio-distribution-Django
This is my second ever Django project done by myself. The project is an audio distribution app, much like Spotify and Soundcloud, where you can create users, upload music, create collections, comment on songs, edit music/collections, and, most importantly, play songs. 

Sidenote: I could not figure out how to do the song player controls you see at the very bottom of the website pages. Help for that is appreciated.
